## Podcast #2 with Darren Myers - designing phono preamplifiers

Here you can find simulation files for this episode. They will work flawlessly with LTSpice 17.1.6. and newer, no 3rd party models are required.

Please note, that placeholder opamps are used. They are okay for general sim, but if you want to polish your design, use models for the parts you'll use in the final version.

About using LTSpice, please refer to: https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/installing-and-using-ltspice-iv-now-including-ltxvii-from-beginner-to-advanced.260627/

Big thank you to Darren Myers of Parasound for providing those files and explaining them in this video: https://youtu.be/-qIodgyc1C4
